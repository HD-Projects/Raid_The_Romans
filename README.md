neighboring Rome trying to survive a Roman invasion. The object of the game is to kill Roman Soilders by placing archer
towers and clicking them with your mouse

# Controls

Click on soilders to kill them, use your mouse to place archer towers by moving them and then clicking any mouse button. Click the settings icon to display settings.

# How To Win

This is an infinite game where you try to stay alive as long as you can, so in other words there is no winning. 
This is historically true for many of Rome's enimies as rome was such a large and powerful country.
