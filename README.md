# Raid-The-Romans

This a project for our social studies unit on Ancient rome. It is a videogame where you play the leader of a country 
neighboring Rome trying to survive a Roman invasion. The object of the game is to kill Roman Soldiers by clicking them with your mouse. Placing an archer unit increases your health by 10 but can't increase your health over 105, archer units cost variable amounts depending on the wave you are on. The base cost of an archer unit is 100 pts.

# Control

Click on soldiers to kill them, use your mouse to place archer tower by clicking anywhere behind your wall. 
 
# How To Win

This is an infinite game where you try to stay alive as long as you can, so in other words there is no winning. 
This is historically true for many of Rome's enimies as rome was such a large and powerful country.
